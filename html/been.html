			<li><h4>Disclaimer: Definitely NOT me.</h4></li>
			<li><img src="../images/guido.jpg" height="195" width="175" alt="#"></li>
			<li><p>I grew up in rural, northern New-Jersey, where hair gel was and Armani were Denver's equivalent of beards and Patagucci. As a small guido I set my sights on education as a means to travel and escape to other, less Scicilian places. </p></li>

			<li><h4>Family</h4></li>
			<li><img src="../images/busey.jpg" height="195" width="175" alt="#"></li>
			<li><p>Didn't have a picture of <em>my</em> family... but this B-roll is pretty sweet.  However... my sister and extended family mean everything to me. The majority of my relatives are scattered around the world, and I'm hoping my new love for programming will eventually enable me to spend more time with them.</p></li>

			<li><img src="../images/dc.jpg" height='250' width="400" alt="#"></li>
			<li><p>I started grad classes in D.C. after graduating, but after an internship for a Defense Contractor, I realized that world was not for me.    So,  I pursued my dream and did what any budding young professional would do... I went skiing.</p></li>

			<li><img src="../images/cblift.jpg" height="300" width="325"  alt="#"></li>
			<li><p>I'm admittedly...a ski bum in remission. Spending the last several several years in Crested Butte has allowed me to explore a variety of outdoor rec sports, and I will never be the same. I'll miss being a powder hound, but that chapter never really ends.</p></li>
